The project was also selected by Cenfotec to participate on behalf of the university, at the biggest regional entrepreneurship competition in Central America (YoEmprendedor). MoneyRoomba was an app developed to help everyone keep track of their finances, developed at Universidad Cenfotec while coursing “Proyecto de Ingeniería de Software III”. MoneyRoomba was developed using an Angular11 Web Application for the Front-End and a Java Spring Back-End application connected to a MySQL database, all hosted in the cloud using Heroku services. We overcame the challenge of using completely new technologies selected by our professors, such as JHipster, with less than 6 weeks' time for development.",

Toquí was developed using a .NET MVC Web Application for the Front-End and a series of C# REST APIs connected to an SQL database for the Back-End. The whole project was developed using Microsoft technologies as a challenge so we had to learn how to use tools like C#, Team Foundation Services (for version control), SQL Server 2017, Visual Studio 2019, and different services from the AzurePortal which helped us get the project from class and sequence diagrams to a fully functional application running completely on the cloud.",
